# rando_art_portfolio

A bunch of random art split into 2 main cateogries:
* Scratch
* Portfolio

Scratch will be meant for random doodles. Just a bunch of random, unfinished things that I draw to concept ideas, practice skills, etc. 
Scratch is more for me to keep track of my history and see my own progress. It's not meant to be good. In fact, it'll probably be pretty bad

Portfolio is where I'll put art that I'm proud of. It will be the living place of my polished art :)
